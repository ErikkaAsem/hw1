    <h3>What's Capusule Cooking?</h3>
<p>
    For busy professionals who must save time and want to save money, 
   <strong>Capsule Cooking </strong>
   is a new meal prep service that 
   <strong>reduces time </strong>   
   in the kitchen to just two hours per week.
</p>
<p>
   Unlike current meal prep apps, 
<strong>Capsule Cooking</strong> 
offers curated capsule recipes that cross-utilize ingredients between recipes, 
    minimizing food waste and time spent prepping and cooking.Â 
  </p>
<p>

<h3>What's Capusule Cooking?</h3>
<p>Capsules are collections of recipes that are deigned to be cooked simultaneously</p>
    By curating capsule recipes that can be prepped and cooked simultaneously, 
    FreshPrep aims to give people back that one resource we all wish would not slip by so quickly: time.
